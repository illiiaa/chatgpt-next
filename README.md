## üß© Develop

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?style=&logo=react&logoColor=black)
![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-000000?style=&logo=vercel&logoColor=white)

Clone this repo, install the dependencies (all locally), and run the development server (which auto-watches the
files for changes):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enricoros/big-agi.git
cd big-agi
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`. Development builds have the advantage of not requiring
a build step, but can be slower than production builds. Also, development builds won't have timeout on edge functions.

## üåê Deploy manually

The _production_ build of the application is optimized for performance and is performed by the `npm run build` command,
after installing the required dependencies.

```bash
# .. repeat the steps above up to `npm install`, then:
npm run build
next start --port 3000
```

The app will be running on the specified port, e.g. `http://localhost:3000`.

Want to deploy with username/password? See the [Authentication](docs/deploy-authentication.md) guide.
